        <h1>TCU Involvement</h1>
        <p>I am extremely involved on campus at TCU. Some of my involvement includes: </p>

        <strong>John V. Roach Honors College</strong><p>Completed Lower Division Honors, and serving as 2021-2022 TA for Professor Williams.

I have enjoyed taking courses such as College Life and Identity with Dr. Boyd, and The GENIUS of Hip-Hop with Dr. Gooding, as well.</p>
        <t><strong>UNLF Peer Guide</strong><p>I will be a peer guide for the Fall 2021 semester for our Intro to University Life course for incoming freshmen. I am so excited to meet the new class of students, and be there to support them through this program!</p></t>
    </div>
    <p>These are just a couple of the things that I do on campus, outside of my computer science courses. I can't wait to grow through both my involvements on campus, and my experiences through my classes, during my last two years at TCU!</p>

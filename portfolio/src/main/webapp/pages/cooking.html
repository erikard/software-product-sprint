        <p>Technically, there is nothing space-related about my cooking. However, I know I'm enjoying the process now, before I move to the moon and am unable to get the same quality of ingredients that I have now, for my cooking... Hahaha! </p>

        <p><strong>Pictured below: </strong>I learned to make sushi recently. I'm definitely still an apprentice, but I'm getting a little better each time!</p>
